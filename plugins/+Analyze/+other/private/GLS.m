% [o,s]=GLS(x,y,v)  : Generalized Least Square fit, linear regression with error. Fits a straight line with offset through data with known variances.
% x : vector of x-values, known postions at which was measured.
% y : vector y-values, measurements.
% v : vector of known errors. These can also be estimated, but if you have a model, use RWLS, the reweighted least squares regression.
%     Specifically look at RWLSPoisson if this fitting is for Poisson statistics.
% o : offset = y-value at zero x-value
% s : slope
