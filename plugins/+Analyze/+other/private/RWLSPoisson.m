% [o,s]=RWLSPoisson(x,y,N)  : Poisson Reweighted Least Square fit, linear regression with error according to the Poisson distribution. Fits a straight line with offset.
% x : vector of x-values, known postions at which was measured.
% y : vector y-values, measurements.
% N : optional number of measurements from which y was obtained by averaging
