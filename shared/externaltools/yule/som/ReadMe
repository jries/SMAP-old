This directory contains Matlab code implementing a multi-dimensional
version of Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map.  Like the traditional version,
this version can work with a two-dimensional grid, but it also supports
mapping to vectors of arbitrary dimensions.  

To get started, download and unzip the file som.zip from this directory into
your Matlab working directory, launch Matlab, and type

  >> addpath src
  >> addpath demo
  >> somdemo(@nicering, 200);

This will run a two-dimensional demo using a ring shape as the input data
set.  Instead of nicering, you can also use the other nice* shape functions. 
You can run a three-dimensional example, with the interior of a cube
as the data set, by typing
 
  >> somdemo(@nicecube, 300);

or however iterations you want to try.  The src directory contains code that
you can use in actual applications.  Most users will probably just want
to use SOM.M, the two-dimensional grid version.  SOMLEARN.M supports learning
in higher dimensions.


Have fun, and contact levys@wlu.edu with any questions.
